# RossmannStoreSales

## Task 1 Analysis
### Overview
This repository contains the code and results for the Task 1 Analysis of the Rossmann Store Sales dataset. The goal of this analysis is to explore the dataset and gain insights into the sales patterns of the Rossmann stores.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Rossmann Store Sales dataset, which contains information about the sales of various stores across different locations.

### Analysis
The analysis is divided into several sections:

*  **Data Exploration**: This section involves loading the dataset and exploring its structure and content.
* **Data Cleaning**: This section involves cleaning the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.
* **Data Transformation**: This section involves transforming the dataset into a suitable format for analysis.
* **Analysis**: This section involves performing various analyses on the dataset, including:
 * Checking the distribution of sales in training and test sets
 * Checking sales behavior before, during, and after holidays
 * Checking seasonal purchase behaviors
 * Checking correlation between sales and number of customers
 * Checking promo effect on sales
 * Checking trends of customer behavior during store opening and closing times
 * Checking which stores are open on all weekdays
 * Checking how assortment type affects sales
### Results on EDA
The results of the analysis are presented in the form of plots and tables.

### Conclusion on EDA
The analysis provides insights into the sales patterns of the Rossmann stores and can be used to inform business decisions.

#### Task 2: Feature Engineering
* **Feature Engineering**: This task involves creating new features that can be used to improve the accuracy of the sales prediction model.
* **Feature Selection**: This task involves selecting the most relevant features to use in the model.
#### Task 3: Model Development
* **Model Development**: This task involves developing a sales prediction model using the engineered features.
* **Model Evaluation**: This task involves evaluating the performance of the model using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE).

### Code
The code for the analysis is written in Python, jupyterNotebooks and uses various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

### Dependencies
* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
